# Simple Inheritance Example.

An example that shows some of the key concept of **inheritance** in object-oriented programming, including:

- A lineage of classes, `A`, `B`, `C`.
- visibility of inherited instance properties
- **Overriding** of inherited classes.
- A class `D` that shows composition rather than inheritance.
